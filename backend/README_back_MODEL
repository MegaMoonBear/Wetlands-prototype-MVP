# **Model Selection** section - 2-layer framing

## Model Selection & Evaluation (Two-Layer Approach)

Model selection in this project is intentionally separated into **two distinct layers**, reflecting the different roles AI plays in user interaction versus downstream analysis. This separation ensures responsible use of AI, minimizes technical risk, and aligns with Phase 1 design constraints.

### Layer 1: Assistive AI for Image-Based Suggestions (User-Facing)

The first layer uses **pre-trained, off-the-shelf image recognition tools** to assist users who may not have prior plant or animal identification experience. Users submit a single image of a pond or waterway, and the system returns a short list of **possible plant or animal suggestions with confidence indicators**. These outputs are explicitly framed as *suggestions*, not authoritative identifications.

No custom model training is performed in Phase 1, and no automated species identification is finalized without human review. This layer exists solely to **reduce user friction**, encourage participation, and help structure downstream data collection.

Model selection at this layer prioritizes:

* Use of existing, well-tested pre-trained tools
* Low operational complexity
* Transparent confidence scoring and disclaimers

Formal model evaluation at this layer focuses on **usability and consistency**, rather than scientific accuracy, as outputs are not treated as ground truth.

### Layer 2: Analytical Models for Structured Data (Back-End)

The second layer applies **traditional analytical and statistical models** to structured, validated data derived from observations and human-reviewed indicators. These models never operate on raw images; instead, they use tabular data such as time, location, water presence, vegetation indicators, and validation status.

Candidate models include:

* **Linear regression and time-series models (e.g., ARIMA)** for detecting seasonal patterns and long-term trends
* **Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest)** for analyzing relationships among environmental indicators
* **Logistic regression** for probabilistic classification of binary conditions (e.g., water present vs absent)

Model selection at this layer is based on **interpretability, performance on small to moderate datasets, and computational simplicity**, consistent with Phase 1 constraints.

Model evaluation uses standard metrics such as RMSE, accuracy, and cross-validation performance, with an emphasis on **explainability and reproducibility** rather than maximum predictive complexity.

### Alignment with Phase 1 Design Principles

This two-layer approach:

* Maintains **lowest possible friction** for users and developers
* Avoids custom model training and advanced image processing
* Minimizes service dependencies and system fragility
* Preserves a clear human-in-the-loop workflow
* Creates a clean foundation for future Phase 2 enhancements

By separating assistive AI from analytical modeling, the project supports novice participation while ensuring that downstream analyses remain rigorous, auditable, and fit for scientific or planning use.

If you want, next I can:

* Add a **one-paragraph “Why not deep learning?” justification**
* Tighten this further for a **federal or foundation grant**
* Map each layer directly to **tables in your data schema**
* Create a **diagram showing the two layers + data flow**

This section is now solid, defensible, and clearly senior-level.
