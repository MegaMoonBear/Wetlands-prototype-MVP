# app.py
# This file serves as the entry point for the backend server.
# Use a framework like Flask or FastAPI to define routes and handle requests.
# Example: Define API endpoints to interact with the frontend and database.
# Ensure proper error handling and logging for debugging.

# Example Flask setup:
# from flask import Flask
# app = Flask(__name__)
# @app.route('/')
# def home():
#     return "Hello, World!"
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app.run(debug=True)

# app.py: If app.py is the entry point for the backend, it might need updates to include routes or endpoints that utilize the Llama 3.2-Vision functionality.
