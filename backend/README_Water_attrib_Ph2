Include **visually observable water characteristics** that the AI can classify from images.
**Yes** — this needs **at least one lookup table**, but you can keep it light for Phase 1.

## Phase 1 framing (important) - Your Phase 1 goal is **signal/suggest, not certainty** 

Using **one indicator species** (plant *or* animal) + **basic visual water traits** is:
* scientifically defensible
* AI-friendly
* easy for users
* expandable later
**NOT inferring chemistry - Visual ecology**

## What the table needs to support in Phase 1
1. One indicator species (presence / absence / confidence)
2. Waterbody context (what kind of water is this?)
3. Visually observable water traits
4. AI confidence + source transparency
5. Room to expand later (without schema pain)

## Recommended Phase 1 Core Table

### `water_observation`

```sql
water_observation (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,

  -- Spatial + context
  location_id UUID,
  waterbody_type_id INT,        -- lookup
  spatial_context_id INT,       -- lookup (urban, rural, etc.)

  -- Indicator species (Phase 1: single species)
  indicator_species_id INT,     -- lookup
  species_presence ENUM(
    'present',
    'absent',
    'uncertain'
  ),

  -- AI-derived visual water traits
  flow_type ENUM(
    'still',
    'slow_moving',
    'fast_moving',
    'unknown'
  ),

  water_color ENUM(
    'clear',
    'brown',
    'green',
    'blue',
    'black',
    'other',
    'unknown'
  ),

  turbidity_level ENUM(
    'low',
    'moderate',
    'high',
    'unknown'
  ),

  surface_conditions SET(
    'foam',
    'oil_sheen',
    'algal_mat',
    'debris',
    'none_observed'
  ),

  -- AI metadata
  ai_confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  classification_source ENUM(
    'ai_image',
    'user_reported',
    'field_verified'
  ),

  observed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

This is **lean enough for Phase 1**, but scientifically meaningful.

---

## Should water characteristics be visually identified by AI?

**Absolutely yes — and this is a strength of your app.**

These traits are:

* observable from photos
* widely used in rapid assessments
* understandable by the public
* correlated with water quality trends

You are not claiming chemistry — you’re claiming **ecological signal**.

This is exactly how early-stage biomonitoring works.

---

## Lookup Tables You Should Have (Minimum)

### 1️⃣ `indicator_species` **(Required)**

```sql
indicator_species (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  scientific_name TEXT,
  common_name TEXT,
  species_group ENUM('plant','invertebrate','fish','amphibian'),
  water_quality_signal ENUM('good','moderate','poor'),
  notes TEXT
);
```

Why:

* You *will* change species later
* Different regions = different indicator organisms
* Keeps science transparent

---

### 2️⃣ `waterbody_type` **(Strongly recommended)**

```sql
waterbody_type (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  code TEXT,
  label TEXT
);
```

Examples:

* stream
* river
* pond
* lake
* wetland
* drainage_ditch

Flow + species interpretation depends on this.

---

### 3️⃣ `spatial_context` (Optional in Phase 1, useful by Phase 2)

Urban vs rural changes expectations dramatically.

---

## What I would NOT add yet (important restraint)

❌ Chemical parameters
❌ Numeric turbidity
❌ pH / DO inference
❌ Multiple species per observation

Those come later *after* trust is built.

---

## Phase 1 → Phase 2 Growth Path (this matters)

Phase 1:

* 1 species
* visual traits
* pattern recognition

Phase 2:

* species groups
* seasonal patterns
* repeated observations
* simple trend indicators

Phase 3:

* sensors
* chemistry
* partner datasets

Your schema already supports this trajectory.

---

## Coach’s bottom line

You’re asking the **right question at the right time**.

This table:

* fits Phase 1 perfectly
* plays to AI’s strengths
* avoids scientific overclaim
* sets you up for credibility

If you want next, I can:

* help pick the **best first indicator species**
* design the **AI prompt + JSON output**
* or write the **Phase 1 methodology blurb** funders love
