## Model Selection & Evaluation (Two-Layer Approach)
Model selection in this project is intentionally separated into **two distinct layers**, reflecting the different roles AI plays in user interaction versus downstream analysis. This separation ensures responsible use of AI, minimizes technical risk, and aligns with Phase 1 design constraints.

### Layer 1: Assistive AI for Image-Based Suggestions (User-Facing)
The first layer... in frontend folder

### Layer 2: Analytical Models for Structured Data (Back-End)
The second layer applies **traditional analytical and statistical models** to structured, validated data. These models never operate on raw images; instead, they use tabular data such as time, location, water presence, water flow (or still), ID tags (vegetation indicators, animal indicators), confidence level, and validation status.
