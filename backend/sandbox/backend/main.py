# Prototype - runs the whole process


# Purpose: Reusable helper functions (loading images, saving JSON)

# syntax to save AI response to results.json file under outputs folder
import json


# Add one-line error handling (file not found, folder missing) - Need a folder? 



# In real projects, helpers move into utils.py, but right now your goal is clarity and meeting the deadline, not perfect architecture.
