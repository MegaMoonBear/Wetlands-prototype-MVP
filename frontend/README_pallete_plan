Nice — I pulled colors and visual cues from the Duck/Chesapeake/Wolf River/T.O. Fuller sites you named to make palettes that actually match wetland photography and conservation branding. (Sources I looked at: Ducks Unlimited, Chesapeake Conservancy/Chesapeake Bay photo galleries, Wolf River Conservancy, and T.O. Fuller State Park.)

Below you’ll find quick, usable color groups (with hex codes), short notes on when to use each color, two ready-to-drop-in 4–5 color palettes, and a couple of reference pages / real-world items you can paste into Canva’s palette tool.

Quick observations from the sites

Photos and banners commonly use deep water blues / navy, forest & marsh greens, muted golds and reed/yellow-golds, and earth/cattail browns; skies and highlights add lighter blue and pale gray/white. These show up in both logo/brand art and hero photos.

(2) Suggested list of 5–9 common, nature/conservation colors (good for headings, icons, accents)

Deep Wetland Blue — #1B4F72 (dark, stable; good for headings)

Pond Teal / Deep Aqua — #0F7A87 (water accent)

Marsh Green — #2F6B3A (mid-dark green for blocks or buttons)

Reed / Gold — #B58F3B (warm accent, calls to marsh grass/sunlight)

Cattail Brown — #6A4228 (rich brown for grounded accents)

Slate / Charcoal for text — #222222 (dark but softer than black; for body/headers)

Mud / Deep Olive — #4A3F35 (alternative darker neutral)

Sky Highlight Blue — #8FBFE6 (use sparingly for highlights)

Pale Sand / Beige — #E9E1D7 (small UI accents, chips)

(Use #222222 or #1B4F72 for darker fonts — both contrast well on light backgrounds.)

Citations for these tonal choices come from the reference images and banners I reviewed on the sites listed above.

(3) 3–5 alternate, darker wetland-related colors (theme names + hex)

Crawfish / Mud Red — #7A2E2E (deep warm red)

Cattail / Reed Brown — #6A4228 (earthy brown used in logos/branding accents)

Deep Peat / Soil — #3F2E2A (very dark neutral for heavy type or footer backgrounds)

Dark Teal / Bog — #133E3A (close to the darkest water shadows)

(4) 3–5 light colors (heron / beak / sky touches)

Heron Gray — #C9CECA (soft gray for cards or secondary backgrounds)

Beak Yellow — #E1C542 (small, friendly accent like a bird beak)

Pale Marsh Tan — #E8DCCF (off-white / warm paper background)

Pale Water Blue — #D7ECF9 (header highlights or callouts)

(5) 2–4 background (reading-friendly, nature-inspired)

Off-white / Eggsheel — #F7F6F2 (main page background)

Warm Sand — #ECE6DD (slightly warm, gentle contrast)

Cool Stone / Pale Gray — #F3F6F8 (clean, modern)

Very Light Sage — #F1F4EF (soft, nature-leaning background option)

Use background colors at 95–100% area; reserve darker brand colors for headers, buttons, and emphasis so body text remains highly readable.

(6) Two recommended versions of a 4–5 color palette

Version A — Classic Wetland (5 colors) — good for an authoritative nonprofit look

Deep Wetland Blue — #1B4F72 (header/title)

Marsh Green — #2F6B3A (buttons/links)

Reed Gold — #B58F3B (accent/highlight)

Cattail Brown — #6A4228 (secondary accent)

Off-white Background — #F7F6F2 (page background)

Version B — Muted Shoreline (4 colors) — softer, modern educational look

Slate Navy (text) — #162A3A

Olive / Bog Green — #4A6A43

Pale Water Blue (accent) — #D7ECF9

Warm Sand background — #ECE6DD

Both palettes pair dark, readable font colors (Slate/Charcoal) with nature-toned accents. Use the Reed Gold or Beak Yellow sparingly as a call-to-action accent.

(7) Reference pages / items to paste into Canva (sites + real-world items)

Use these pages as ready visual references (they include 4–6 of the palette colors in one image or banner):

Ducks Unlimited — wetland hero & conservation imagery (good mix of deep blue, marsh green, gold, brown).

Chesapeake Conservancy — aerial marsh photos showing multiple blues, greens, and golds in one frame.

If you prefer real-world items / animals to pull a palette from (good for Canva’s “extract palette” on an image):

Mallard drake (green head, brown chest, gray body, dark blue speculum)

Cattail seed-head and reed (dark brown, tan, reed-gold)

Great blue heron (soft gray, pale blue, beak yellow)

Sunset-over-marsh photo (deep navy water, gold sky, green marsh, brown mud)

Those animals / items are especially useful because a single photo of any one of them will often contain 4–6 palette colors you can extract in Canva. Example: a mallard or a marsh-aerial shot will give dark navy/blue, green, brown, gold in one pass.
