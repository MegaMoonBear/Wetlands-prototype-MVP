Primary███ | # Frontend Palette

Logo is teal (Darker teals #0C948B, Deep Blue-Teal #2F6F73, or Soft Marine Teal #3F8C8E), black, white, and one small, medium-red accent (approximately #940c15 for red-ear slider's red accent; #B23A2C → #C4472D as terracotta-leaning reds) - see ./WaterSnapMap_Logo_ChatGPT.png

On partners' websites, photos and banners commonly use deep water blues / navy, forest & marsh greens, muted golds and reed/yellow-golds, and earth/cattail browns; skies and highlights add lighter blue and pale gray/white. 

Pair dark, readable font colors with nature-toned accents. Use dark reds and Gold or Yellow sparingly as a call-to-action accent.

1. Palette logic (why this works)
    Readability & eye strain

    Body reading happens on very light, warm-neutral backgrounds (not stark white, not cool gray).

    Text colors are dark, low-saturation blues/greens, which reduce glare compared to pure black.

    Saturated colors (reds, golds, teal accents) are never used for body text.

    Water & wetlands signal

    Hue families: blue-teal + marsh green + reed gold + mud red

    This mirrors Ducks Unlimited–style wetlands photography without copying it.

    Color-blind safety

    Critical distinctions rely on lightness + placement, not just hue.

    Red and gold are accent-only and never paired together without separation.

    Dark teal/blue chosen for text performs well across common color-vision deficiencies.

2. Final chosen colors - 9 colors total, which is a sweet spot for consistency and accessibility
    Headings, icons, accents
        Deep Wetland Blue (primary text + headings)
        Dark Teal / Bog (footer, nav bars, heavy emphasis)
        Pond Teal / Deep Aqua (iconography, secondary accents)
        Marsh Green (buttons, map layers, status indicators)
        Crawfish / Mud Red (very sparing CTA / alert accent)

    Light accents: Reed / Gold (CTA highlight, hover states, counts)

    Backgrounds (2 total)
        blanched almond (primary reading surface)
                (or a similar pale, contrast-appropriate, warm color) - blanched almond (#FFEBCD) (NOT Off-white / Eggshell)
        Very Light Sage (secondary panels, cards, map UI)


# Practical implementation rules (important)

    Text

    Body text: Deep Wetland Blue on Eggshell or Light Sage

    Never use teal, red, or gold for paragraphs

    Buttons

    Default: Marsh Green background + white text

    Hover: Marsh Green → slightly darker (not gold)

    Critical CTA: Crawfish Red + white text (use once per screen max)

    Maps & data layers

    Base UI: Very Light Sage

    Active layers: Pond Teal

    Warnings/flags: Crawfish Red (icon only, not fills)

    Gold usage

    Treat gold like punctuation, not prose

    Think: badges, counts, hover outlines, subtle dividers

# INSTRUCTIONS for AI
(A) Choose 3-5 for headings, icons, accents - Considering more common color-blind types, choose one of the darker colors for text. And define uses for all chosen colors. Reserve darker brand colors for headers, buttons, and emphasis so body text remains highly readable. Narrow this list, in consideration the 2 following lists. 
Choose 1-2 of 3 blues/teals
Deep Wetland Blue — #1B4F72 (dark, stable; good for headings) for darker fonts — both contrast well on light backgrounds
Dark Teal / Bog — #133E3A (close to the darkest water shadows; for heavy type or footer backgrounds)
Pond Teal / Deep Aqua — #0F7A87 (water accent)
KEEP: Marsh Green — #2F6B3A (mid-dark green for blocks or buttons)
KEEP: Crawfish / Mud Red — #7A2E2E (deep warm red; already used in logos/branding accents; Use sparingly as a call-to-action accent.)
Choose 1-2 of the next 2, if useful.
Cattail Brown — #6A4228 (rich brown for grounded accents)
Mud / Deep Olive — #4A3F35 (alternative darker neutral)

(B) Choose 1-2 light colors, for sparing accents, such as call-to-action
Choose between yellow and gold, then use sparingly as a call-to-action accent.
Beak Yellow — #E1C542 (small, friendly accent like a bird beak); OR 
Reed / Gold — #B58F3B (warm accent, calls to marsh grass/sunlight)
Choose between next 2, then use sparingly if useful as an accent or another use
Pale Marsh Tan — #E8DCCF (off-white / warm paper background)
Pale Water Blue — #D7ECF9 (header highlights or callouts)

(C) Choose 1-2 background (reading-friendly, nature-inspired) - Use background colors at 95–100% area; reserve darker brand colors for headers, buttons, and emphasis so body text remains highly readable.
Off-white / Eggshell — #F7F6F2 (main page background)
Warm Sand — #ECE6DD (slightly warm, gentle contrast)
Very Light Sage — #F1F4EF (soft, nature-leaning background option)

Nice — I pulled colors and visual cues from the Duck/Chesapeake/Wolf River/T.O. Fuller sites you named to make palettes that actually match wetland photography and conservation branding. (Sources I looked at: Ducks Unlimited, Chesapeake Conservancy/Chesapeake Bay photo galleries, Wolf River Conservancy, and T.O. Fuller State Park.)

Below you’ll find quick, usable color groups (with hex codes), short notes on when to use each color, two ready-to-drop-in 4–5 color palettes, and a couple of reference pages / real-world items you can paste into Canva’s palette tool.

Quick observations from the sites

Photos and banners commonly use deep water blues / navy, forest & marsh greens, muted golds and reed/yellow-golds, and earth/cattail browns; skies and highlights add lighter blue and pale gray/white. These show up in both logo/brand art and hero photos.

(2) Suggested list of 5–9 common, nature/conservation colors (good for headings, icons, accents)

Deep Wetland Blue — #1B4F72 (dark, stable; good for headings)

Pond Teal / Deep Aqua — #0F7A87 (water accent)

Marsh Green — #2F6B3A (mid-dark green for blocks or buttons)

Reed / Gold — #B58F3B (warm accent, calls to marsh grass/sunlight)

Cattail Brown — #6A4228 (rich brown for grounded accents)

Slate / Charcoal for text — #222222 (dark but softer than black; for body/headers)

Mud / Deep Olive — #4A3F35 (alternative darker neutral)

Sky Highlight Blue — #8FBFE6 (use sparingly for highlights)

Pale Sand / Beige — #E9E1D7 (small UI accents, chips)

(Use #222222 or #1B4F72 for darker fonts — both contrast well on light backgrounds.)

Citations for these tonal choices come from the reference images and banners I reviewed on the sites listed above.

(3) 3–5 alternate, darker wetland-related colors (theme names + hex)

Crawfish / Mud Red — #7A2E2E (deep warm red)

Cattail / Reed Brown — #6A4228 (earthy brown used in logos/branding accents)

Deep Peat / Soil — #3F2E2A (very dark neutral for heavy type or footer backgrounds)

Dark Teal / Bog — #133E3A (close to the darkest water shadows)

(4) 3–5 light colors (heron / beak / sky touches)

Heron Gray — #C9CECA (soft gray for cards or secondary backgrounds)

Beak Yellow — #E1C542 (small, friendly accent like a bird beak)

Pale Marsh Tan — #E8DCCF (off-white / warm paper background)

Pale Water Blue — #D7ECF9 (header highlights or callouts)

(5) 2–4 background (reading-friendly, nature-inspired)

Off-white / Eggshell — #F7F6F2 (main page background)

Warm Sand — #ECE6DD (slightly warm, gentle contrast)

Cool Stone / Pale Gray — #F3F6F8 (clean, modern)

Very Light Sage — #F1F4EF (soft, nature-leaning background option)

Use background colors at 95–100% area; reserve darker brand colors for headers, buttons, and emphasis so body text remains highly readable.

(6) Two recommended versions of a 4–5 color palette

Version A — Classic Wetland (5 colors) — good for an authoritative nonprofit look

Deep Wetland Blue — #1B4F72 (header/title)

Marsh Green — #2F6B3A (buttons/links)

Reed Gold — #B58F3B (accent/highlight)

Cattail Brown — #6A4228 (secondary accent)

Off-white Background — #F7F6F2 (page background)

Version B — Muted Shoreline (4 colors) — softer, modern educational look

Slate Navy (text) — #162A3A

Olive / Bog Green — #4A6A43

Pale Water Blue (accent) — #D7ECF9

Warm Sand background — #ECE6DD

Both palettes pair dark, readable font colors (Slate/Charcoal) with nature-toned accents. Use the Reed Gold or Beak Yellow sparingly as a call-to-action accent.

(7) Reference pages / items to paste into Canva (sites + real-world items)

Use these pages as ready visual references (they include 4–6 of the palette colors in one image or banner):

Ducks Unlimited — wetland hero & conservation imagery (good mix of deep blue, marsh green, gold, brown).

Chesapeake Conservancy — aerial marsh photos showing multiple blues, greens, and golds in one frame.

If you prefer real-world items / animals to pull a palette from (good for Canva’s “extract palette” on an image):

Mallard drake (green head, brown chest, gray body, dark blue speculum)

Cattail seed-head and reed (dark brown, tan, reed-gold)

Great blue heron (soft gray, pale blue, beak yellow)

Sunset-over-marsh photo (deep navy water, gold sky, green marsh, brown mud)

Those animals / items are especially useful because a single photo of any one of them will often contain 4–6 palette colors you can extract in Canva. Example: a mallard or a marsh-aerial shot will give dark navy/blue, green, brown, gold in one pass.
