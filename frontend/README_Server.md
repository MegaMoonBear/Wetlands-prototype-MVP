# How to See Your Frontend

## Steps to Start the Development Server

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open a terminal in the `frontend` folder.
   - Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Run the following command to start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Open the Frontend in Your Browser**:
   - After running the above command, the terminal will display a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
   - Open this URL in your browser to view your frontend.

## Notes
- **Do Not Use "Go Live"**:
  - The "Go Live" button in VS Code is for static files and will not work with React's development server.
- **Restarting the Server**:
  - If you need to restart the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop it, then run `npm start` again.
