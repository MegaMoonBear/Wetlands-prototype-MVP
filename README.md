# Wetlands-prototype-MVP

Clone the repository. Do not fork.
  
Cloning is the right move, since I: 
   
   - Started the repo yourself in GitHub
  
   - Will be coding locally in VS Code
  
   - Intend to push changes back to that same repo
  
Cloning:
  
   - Creates a local working copy on your machine
  
   - Keeps the repo connected to GitHub (origin)
  
   - Is the standard workflow for solo or primary-owner projects
